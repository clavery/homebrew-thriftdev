homebrew-thrift-dev
===================

This `tap` includes my development version of Apache Thrift. It includes a thrift 1.0.0dev build with
my own changes that are not in the upstream (mostly AngularJS build support and minor fixes/changes).

The thrift-dev name is chosen as this isn't intended to be a dupe of homebrews own thrift installation,
although it is still not compatible with that version.

Installation
------------

```sh
$ brew tap clavery/thrift-dev
$ brew install thrift-dev
```
